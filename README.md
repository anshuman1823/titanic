Titanic Kaggle Competition

This is my first machine learning project and I'm really excited about it :)

In this project, I'll use the Titanic Passenger Dataset to predict whether the passengers will survive or not. This is a Kaggle Competition. The link for the competition is "https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview".

"titanic_notebook.ipynb" will include all the Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, and the best estimator, which for now is Random Forest. I have organized the notebook in such a way that it can be easily run in a standalone manner without any prerequisites. The libraries used by me in the notebook have been exported in the "requirements.txt" file and can be installed using the command : "pip install -r requirements.txt".

All the experimental work will be done in a separate notebook called "experimental_titanic_notebook.ipynb", where I'll try out different estimators and different techniques to improve the accuracy of the model.

In this competition, we are provided with a training dataset containing 891 entries and we have to make predictions on a test dataset which contains 418 entries. For more information on the datasets and to download the datasets, visit the kaggle webpage for the competition.

As of now, I have achieved the highest prediction accuracy of 78 % on the test dataset with "Random Forest Classifier".

In this project, I have tried to create functions for most of the data preprocessing tasks, so that i don't have to repeat the same code again and again. I have also tried to make it informative and presentable, so that others can easily understand what I'm doing.

Since this is my first project, I know it must contain many mistakes...so, don't get frustated and please bear with me. I'll keep working on this project and try to improve it in the future as I learn more about Machine Learning.

Kudos.
